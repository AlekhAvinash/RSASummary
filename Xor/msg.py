msg = b"""XOR or exclusive-or explicitly states "one or the other, 
but not neither nor both." It's primary use is to emphasize the perfect 
indifference between two or more things or courses. It also functions as 
a function to show mutual exclusiveness. But Cryptography found its use in
createing unbreakable block ciphers and to create almost perfect random
number generators. It is also known as exclusive disjuction opeation and 
modulus addition. A freqency analysis solves me but how to solve a random
index generating key? Here's a hint.. its not so random. Look for prime
power rings. Another danger of using repeated xor cipher is if the attacker 
knew the plaintext a part or the entire key could be recoverd without using
freqency analysis to solve the problem."""
